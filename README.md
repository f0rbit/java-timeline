Old project that gives a timeline of github commits, reddit posts, and tweets all in one request.

Used for my personal website, don't think twitter works anymore due to the API changes / paid API usage.

No longer working on this as switching focus to `media-timeline` project, which will fulfill the same role as this project and eventually replace it.
